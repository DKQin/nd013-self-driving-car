### Project 1: Finding Lane Lines on the Road
![Finding Lane Lines on the Road](p1_lane_finding/preview.gif)  
#### Problem
Detection of lane lines on a video
#### Solution
Using [Canny edge detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector) and [Hough transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform) implementations from [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) I extracted candidate lane lines from individual frames based on level of confidence and assumptions about spatial characteristics (position, angle and length). The final lane lines **in the individual frame** are weighted averages of the frame's candidate lines (longer candidates have larger weights). Resulting lane lines **on the video** are averages of the final lane lines from current and several previous individual frames. All variables were manually tuned.
